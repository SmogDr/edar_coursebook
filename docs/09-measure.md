## Sampling
To conduct univariate analyses, we need observations (i.e., we need to collect some data).  To get those data, we need a sample.  To get that sample, we need to identify a population from which to sample.  Allow me to digress...  

### Samples vs. Populations  
At some point in the history of science someone came up with the idea that very few things are known for certain: we can only make estimates or educated guesses. This idea (which is hard to refute) gave rise to the concept of *samples* vs. *populations*.  In statistics, the ***population*** of an observed quantity or variable is the totality of every instance of that variable in the universe (...whoa...).  

Take the molecular diameter of an oxygen molecule. Even if we could measure the diameters of ALL the oxygen molecues in our atmosphere that would still represent only a tiny fraction (i.e., a ***sample***) of all the oxygen molecules bound up in the planet (and all of Earth's oxygen is but a tiny fraction of our solar system's, and so on). The *population* of all oxygen molecules across the universe is impossible to measure or "know" given our current capabilities. If, however, we measure a sufficient *sample* of oxygen molecules, we could probably infer the size of all the other O~2~ molecules within reason.

This is to say that the **population** is the thing we strive to make conclusions about but the **sample** is the thing (read: the data) that we have to work with.

### Collecting a sample  
Samples are thus collected to provide estimates of populations so that those estimates can be used for ***inference*** (another fancy word that means: to make conclusions).  Many statistical procedures are based on the assumption that your sample is ***representative*** of the population you are trying to model/understand.  Assuming that your sample is good (read: representative) is a dangerous thing to do. In fact, MOST samples have some degree of un-good.  Just ask the polling experts from the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or the now humiliated and vilified doctor who concluded that vaccines were the cause of childhood autism based on a [sample of 12 kids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954080/) taken from a single birthday party...  

A sample is representative if each measure is drawn in a way that makes it ***independent*** from the next AND if the measurement method itself is ***unbiased*** (i.e., the making of the measurement does not alter the way the sample is counted). We will talk more about ***bias*** in Chapter X, but suffice it so say that if I made you watch a 10-minute video on catastrophic airplane disasters and then gave you a survey about your fears of flying, I might be introducing some bias into that measurement.

Representative sampling is hard to do in practice.  A good strategy to employ when collecting samples is to employ ***randomization***: allow random chance to decide when and where you take the next measurement. The problem with this plan, however, is that we have to put boundaries on the exact *when* and *where* of sampling because we don't have unlimited reach or resources. In reality, most samples are neither independent, nor randomly drawn; they are instead drawn from a single location, one after the next, for a short period of time. Such a *convenience sample* means that any given measure is probably related (correlated) to the next one taken.  Scientific studies occasionally reach incorrect conclusions not because their statistical models were flawed, but instead because their sample was biased and/or unrepresentative of the true population. I can randomly pick out 100 people from a political rally but that doens't mean the opinions I gather from these individuals are representative of all eligible voters in that part of the country. 

This is a much bigger problem than you might realize, because true random, unbiased sampling is often impossible or impractical in the real world. How would the Tesla Corporation collect a random, independent sample of 1000 [Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/model3) vehciles after 10 years of real-world driving? Even with a random number generator applied to vehicle ID numbers, Tesla no longer owns those cars. They can't just take them back...   

- They could ask car owers to complete a customer satisfaction survey but then they might only get results from people who want to complain...(*bias*)  

- They could ask dealers to inspect cars but then they would be sampling only from the subset of owners that liked to do business with dealers...(potential for *bias* AND *non-independence*)  

- They could ask repair shops for data but then they would only be sampling from cars that had broken down for some reason...(potential for *bias* and *non-independence*)  

So...if you cannot collect a truly representative sample, how can you trust your results? More to come on this in later chapters, but suffice it to say that there is an art to empirical research (empirical is a fancy word for observational).
