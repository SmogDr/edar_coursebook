Most of my job at the university is to conduct research, yet most of the students who show up to my lab don’t know where to begin when presented with data. The irony here is that while engineering students are continuously drilled on how to solve problems, they are rarely taught how to seek them out. My first undergraduate research advisor, Dr. David Hemenway, once told me: “the data are always trying to tell you something.” This book is an introduction to data listening, because listening comes before understanding. In broad terms, scientific and engineering research is about discovery: finding out something new. In practice, however, the act of research is really about failure. In research (over the short term) we tend to fail far more often than we succeed. Such failure is to be expected because cutting-edge research ain’t easy. Once you come to terms with accepting failure as a regular occurrence, you put yourself in a position to learn from it. To learn from failure requires that you observe and diagnose “what went wrong” and to do that, you need to listen to what your data is telling you. Let’s begin. 1.1 How to use this book The book is intended to be a sort of self-help guide for students who want to learn R programming and the art of engineering data science. The book is designed to get you started in the art, not master it. I’m not qualified to teach mastery in the art of R or engineering data science, so look elsewhere for that level of tutelage. If you are a beginner to these topics, you probably want to start at the beginning and proceed through each chapter sequentially. Some material might seem boring or too easy…in that case just skip to the end of the section and see if you can complete the exercises and answer the questions. 1.2 Prerequisites MECH 201 1.3 Grading 1.3.1 Grading for MECH 481A6 Course grades will be determined by the following five components: Assessment component Percent of grade Exams 60 Quizzes 25 Homework 15 1.4 Course set-up Please download and install the latest version of: R and RStudio (Desktop version, Open Source edition). Both are free for anyone to download. Students will also need to download and install git software and create a GitHub account. Here are useful links for this set-up: R: https://cran.r-project.org RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads (only ERHS 535 / 581A4) Sign-up for a GitHub account: https://github.com (only ERHS 535 / 581A4) 1.5 Coursebook This coursebook will serve as the only required textbook for this course. I regularly edit and add to this book, so content may change somewhat over the semester (particularly for later weeks. We typically cover about a chapter of the book every 1-2 weeks of the course. This coursebook includes: Links to the slides presented in class for each topic In-course exercises, typically including links to the data used in the exercise Homework assignments Appendix of reference distributions A list of vocabulary and concepts that should be mastered for each quiz If you find any typos or bugs, or if you have any suggestions for how the book can be improved, feel free to post it on the book’s GitHub Issues page. This book was developed using Yihui Xie’s bookdown framework. The book is built using code that combines R code, data, and text to create a book for which R code and examples can be re-executed every time the book is re-built, which helps identify bugs and broken code examples quickly. The online book is hosted using GitHub’s free GitHub Pages. All material for this book is available and can be explored at the book’s GitHub repository. 1.5.1 Other helpful books (not required) The best book to supplement the coursebook and lectures for this course is R for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. The entire book is freely available online through the same format at the coursebook. You can also purchase a paper version of the book (published by O’Reilly) through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc., for around $40. This book is an excellent and up-to-date reference by some of the best R programmers in the world. There are a number of other useful books available on general R programming, including: R for Dummies R Cookbook R Graphics Cookbook Roger Peng’s Leanpub books Various books on bookdown.org The R programming language is used extensively within certain fields, including statistics and bioinformatics. If you are using R for a specific type of analysis, you will be able to find many books with advice on using R for both general and specific statistical analysis, including many available in print or online through the CSU library.
