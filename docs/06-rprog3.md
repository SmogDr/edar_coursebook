## Objectives

After this chapter, you should (know / understand / be able to ):

- Convert a column to a date format using `lubridate` functions
- Extract information from a date object (e.g., month, year, day of week) using `lubridate` functions
- Search, organize, and visualize data that are linked according to date objects
- Manipulate character strings using the `stringr` and `tidyr` packages of functions
- Parse strings using regular expressions (regex)
- Define the main characteristics of "Tidy Data"
- Apply the `tidyr` package of functions to create tidy data


## Dates
## Dates in R

As part of the data cleaning process, you may want to change the class of some
of the columns in the dataframe. For example, you may want to change a column
from a character to a date.

Here are some of the most common vector classes in R:

Class        | Example
------------ | -----------------------------------
`character`  | "Chemistry", "Physics", "Mathematics"
`numeric`    | 10, 20, 30, 40
`factor`     | Male [underlying number: 1], Female [2]
`Date`       | "2010-01-01" [underlying number: 14,610]
`logical`    | TRUE, FALSE

To find out the class of a vector (including a column in a dataframe -- remember
each column can be thought of as a vector), you can use `class()`:


```r
class(daily_show$date)
```

```
## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `date`.
```

```
## [1] "NULL"
```

It is especially common to need to convert dates during the data cleaning
process, since date columns will usually be read into R as characters or
factors---you can do some interesting things with vectors that are in a Date
class that you cannot do with a vector in a character class.

To convert a vector to the `Date` class, if you'd like to only use base R, you
can use the `as.Date` function. I'll walk through how to use `as.Date`, since
it's often used in older R code. However, I recommend in your own code that you
instead use the `lubridate` package, which I'll talk about later in this
section.

To convert a vector to the `Date` class, you can use functions in the
`lubridate` package. This package has a series of functions based on the order
that date elements are given in the incoming character with date information.
For example, in "12/31/99", the date elements are given in the order of month
(**m**), day (**d**), year (**y**), so this character string could be converted
to the date class with the function `mdy`. As another example, the `ymd`
function from lubridate can be used to parse a column into a Date class,
regardless of the original format of the date, as long as the date elements are
in the order: year, month, day. For example:


```r
library("lubridate")
ymd("2008-10-13")
```

```
## [1] "2008-10-13"
```

```r
ymd("'08 Oct 13")
```

```
## [1] "2008-10-13"
```

```r
ymd("'08 Oct 13")
```

```
## [1] "2008-10-13"
```

To convert the `date` column in the `daily_show` data into a Date
class, then, you can run:


```r
library(package = "lubridate")

class(x = daily_show$date) # Check the class of the 'date' column before mutating it
```

```
## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `date`.
```

```
## [1] "NULL"
```

```r
daily_show <- rename(.data = daily_show,
                     year = YEAR,
                     job = GoogleKnowlege_Occupation, 
                     date = Show, 
                     category = Group,
                     guest_name = Raw_Guest_List)

daily_show <- mutate(.data = daily_show,
                     date = mdy(date))
head(x = daily_show, n = 3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 5
##    year job                date       category guest_name     
##   <dbl> <chr>              <date>     <chr>    <chr>          
## 1  1999 actor              1999-01-11 Acting   Michael J. Fox 
## 2  1999 Comedian           1999-01-12 Comedy   Sandra Bernhard
## 3  1999 television actress 1999-01-13 Acting   Tracey Ullman
```

```r
class(x = daily_show$date) # Check the class of the 'date' column after mutating it
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

Once you have an object in the `Date` class, you can do things like plot by
date, calculate the range of dates, and calculate the total number of days the
dataset covers:


```r
range(daily_show$date)
diff(x = range(daily_show$date))
```

We could have used these to transform the date in `daily_show`, using the following pipe chain: 


```r
daily_show <- read_csv(file = "data/daily_show_guests.csv",
                       skip = 4) %>%
  rename(job = GoogleKnowlege_Occupation, 
         date = Show,
         category = Group,
         guest_name = Raw_Guest_List) %>%
  select(-YEAR) %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>%
  filter(category == "Science")
head(x = daily_show, n = 2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 4
##   job          date       category guest_name     
##   <chr>        <date>     <chr>    <chr>          
## 1 neurosurgeon 2003-04-28 Science  Dr Sanjay Gupta
## 2 scientist    2004-01-13 Science  Catherine Weitz
```

The `lubridate` package also includes functions to pull out certain elements of a date, including: 

- `wday`
- `mday`
- `yday`
- `month`
- `quarter`
- `year`

For example, we could use `wday` to create a new column with the weekday of each show: 


```r
mutate(.data = daily_show,
       show_day = wday(x = date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  select(date, show_day, guest_name) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   date       show_day guest_name            
##   <date>     <ord>    <chr>                 
## 1 2003-04-28 Mon      Dr Sanjay Gupta       
## 2 2004-01-13 Tue      Catherine Weitz       
## 3 2004-06-15 Tue      Hassan Ibrahim        
## 4 2005-09-06 Tue      Dr. Marc Siegel       
## 5 2006-02-13 Mon      Astronaut Mike Mullane
