"0","You will often see time referenced with a **""UTC""**, which stands for *""Universal Time, Coordinated""*.  UTC is preferred by programmers  because it doesn't have a timezone and it doesn't follow *Daylight Savings Time* conventions (DST is the bane of many coders).

In practice, UTC is the same time as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time, pronounced ""gren-itch"") but with an important distinction.  GMT is one of the many [time-zones](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) across the planet, whereas, UTC has no time zone."
