# Introduction {#intro}
 <font size=""5""> Preface </font>

I wrote this book to help engineers begin to *think* about data.  Most of my job at the university is to conduct research, yet most of the students who show up to my lab don't know where to begin when presented with data.  The irony here is that while engineering students are continuously drilled on how to solve problems, they are rarely taught how to seek them out.  My first undergraduate research advisor, Dr. David Hemenway, once told me: ""the data are always trying to tell you something.""  This book is an introduction to data listening, because listening comes before understanding.

In broad terms, scientific and engineering research is about discovery: finding out something new. In practice, however, the act of research is really about failure. In research (over the short term) we tend to fail far more often than we succeed.  Such failure is to be expected because cutting-edge research ain't easy.  Once you come to terms with accepting failure as a regular occurrence, you put yourself in a position to learn from it. To learn from failure requires that you observe and diagnose ""what went wrong"" and to do that, you need to listen to what your data is telling you.  Let's begin.

## How to use this book
The book is intended to be a sort of *self-help* guide for students who want to learn R programming and the art of engineering data science.  The book is designed to get you started in the art, not master it. I'm not qualified to teach mastery in the art of R or engineering data science, so look elsewhere for that level of tutelage.

If you are a beginner to these topics, you probably want to start at the beginning and proceed through each chapter sequentially.  Some material might seem boring or too easy...in that case just skip to the end of the section and see if you can complete the exercises and answer the questions.
