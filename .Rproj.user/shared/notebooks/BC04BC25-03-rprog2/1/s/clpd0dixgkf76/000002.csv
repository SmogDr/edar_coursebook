"0","The `readr` package is a member of the tidyverse of packages. The *tidyverse*
describes an evolving collection of R packages with a common philosophy, and
they are unquestionably changing the way people code in R. Many were developed
in part or full by Hadley Wickham and others at RStudio. Many of these packages
are less than ten years old, but have been rapidly adapted by the R community.
As a result, newer examples of R code will often look very different from the
code in older R scripts, including examples in books that are more than a few
years old. In this course, I'll focus on ""tidyverse"" functions when possible,
but I do put in details about base R equivalent functions or processes at some
points---this will help you interpret older code. You can download all the
tidyverse packages using `install.packages(""tidyverse"")`, `library(""tidyverse"")`
makes all the tidyverse functions available for use. "
