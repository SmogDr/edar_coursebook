"0","Many of the functions in tidyverse packages, including those in `dplyr`, provide
exceptions to the general rule about when to use quotation marks versus when to
leave them off. Unfortunately, this may make it a bit hard to learn when to use
quotation marks versus when not to. One way to think about this, which is a bit
of an oversimplification but can help as you're learning, is to assume that
anytime you're using a `dplyr` function, every column in the dataframe you're
working with has been loaded to your R session as its own object."
