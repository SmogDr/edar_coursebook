"0","The `readr` package is a member of the `tidyverse` suite of R packages. The
*tidyverse* describes an evolving collection of R packages with a common
philosophy and approach, and they are unquestionably changing the way people
code in R. Many of these R packages were developed in part or full by Hadley
Wickham and others at RStudio. Many of these packages are less than ten years
old but have been rapidly adapted by the R community. As a result, newer
examples of R code will often look very different from the code in older R
scripts, including examples in books that are more than a few years old. In
this course, I'll focus on `tidyverse` functions when possible, but I do put in
details about base R equivalent functions or processes at some points. This
will help you interpret older code. You can download all the `tidyverse`
packages at the same time with `install.packages(""tidyverse"")` and make all the
`tidyverse` functions available for use with`library(""tidyverse"")`."
