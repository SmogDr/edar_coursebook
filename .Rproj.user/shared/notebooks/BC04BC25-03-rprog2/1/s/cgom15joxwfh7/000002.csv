must reassign the object to be the output of `rename`. If you run one of these
cleaning functions without reassigning the object, R will print out the result,
but the object itself won't change. You can take advantage of this, as I've done
in this example, to look at the result of applying a function to a dataframe
without changing the original dataframe. This can be helpful as you're figuring
out how to write your code."
