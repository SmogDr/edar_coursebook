"0","There are base R functions for both of these tasks (i.e., `data.frame()` and
`read.csv()`, respectively), eliminating the need to load additional packages
with a `library()` call. The series of packages that make up what's called the
""tidyverse"" have brought a huge improvement in the ease and speed of working
with data in R. We will be teaching these tools in this course, and that's why
we're going directly to `tibble()` and `read_csv()` from the start, rather than
base R equivalents. Later in the course, we'll talk more about this ""tidyverse""
and what makes it so great."
