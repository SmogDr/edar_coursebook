"0","One thing that people often find confusing when they start using R is knowing
when to use and not use quotation marks. The general rule is that you use
quotation marks when you want to refer to a character string literally, but no
quotation marks when you want to refer to the value in a previously-defined
object. 

For example, if you saved the string `""Volckens""` as the object `my_name`
(`my_name <- ""Volckens""`), then in later code, if you type `my_name` (no
quotation marks), you'll get `""Volckens""`, while if you type out `""my_name""`
(with quotation marks), you'll get `""my_name""` (what you typed). 

One thing that makes this rule confusing is that there are a few cases in R
where you really should, following this rule, use quotation marks, but the
function is coded to let you be lazy and get away without them. One example is
the `library()` function. In the code earlier in this section to load the
""phonenumber"" package, you want to load the package ""phonenumber"" (with
quotation marks), rather than load whatever character string is saved in the
object named `phonenumber`. But, `library()` is one of the functions where you
can be lazy and skip the quotation marks, and it will still load the package.
Therefore, this function works if you do or do not use quotation marks around
the package name. "
