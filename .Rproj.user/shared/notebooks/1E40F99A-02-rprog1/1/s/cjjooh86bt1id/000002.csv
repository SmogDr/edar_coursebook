"0","We've talked here about loading packages using the `library` function to access
their functions. However, this is not the only way to access the package's
functions. The syntax `[package name]::[function name]` (e.g.,
`phonenumber::letterToNumber(fedex)`) will allow you to use a function from a
package you have installed on your computer, even if its package has not been
loaded in the current R session. Typically, this syntax is not used much in data
analysis scripts, in part because it makes the code much longer. However, you
will occassionally see it used to distinguish between two functions from
different packages that have the same name, as this format makes the desired
function unambiguous. One example where this syntax often is needed is when both
`plyr` and `dplyr` packages are loaded in an R session, since these share
functions with the same name."
