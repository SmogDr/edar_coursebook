"0","We've talked here about loading packages using the `library()` function to
access their functions. This is not the only way to access the package's
functions. The syntax `[package name]::[function name]` will allow you to use a
function from a package you have installed on your computer, even if its
package has not been loaded in the current R session. Typically, this syntax is
not used much in data analysis scripts, in part because it makes the code much
longer. You will occasionally see it in learning contexts to build familiarity
with the package::function connection and in which package a function exists.
It is also used to distinguish between two functions from different packages
that have the same name, as this format makes the desired function unambiguous.
One example where this syntax often is needed is when both `plyr` and `dplyr`
packages are loaded in an R session, since these share functions with the same
name."
