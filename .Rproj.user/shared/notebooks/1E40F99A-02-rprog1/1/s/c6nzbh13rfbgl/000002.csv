"0","Sometimes, you'll want to create an object that you won't want to keep for very
long. For example, you might want to create a small object to test some code,
but you plan to not need the object again once you've done that. You may want to
come up with some short, generic object names that you use for these kinds of
objects, so that you'll know that you can delete them without problems when you
want to clean up your R session.
There are all kinds of traditions for these placeholder variable names in
computer science. `foo` and `bar` are two popular choices, as are, evidently,
`xyzzy`, `spam`, `ham`, and `norf`. There are different placeholder names in
different languages: for example, `toto`, `truc`, and `azerty` (French); and
`pippo`, `pluto`, `paperino` (Disney character names; Italian). See the
Wikipedia page on [metasyntactic
variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) to find out
more."
