"0","R vectors can have several different *classes*. One common class is the
character class, which is the class of the character string we're using here
(""GoFedEx""). You'll always put character strings in quotation marks. Another key
class is numeric (numbers). Later in the course, we'll introduce other classes
that vectors can have, including factors and dates. For the simplest vector
classes, these classes are determined by the type of data that the vector
stores."
