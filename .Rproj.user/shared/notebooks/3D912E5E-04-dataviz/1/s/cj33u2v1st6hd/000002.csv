"0","While the `ggplot` call is the place where you will most often see an `aes` call, you can also make calls to `aes`  within the calls to specific geoms. This can be particularly useful if you want to map aesthetics differently for different geoms in your plot. We'll see some examples of this use of `aes` more in later sections, when we talk about customizing plots. The `data` parameter can also be used in geom calls, to use a different data frame from the one defined when creating the original ggplot object, although this tends to be less common. "
