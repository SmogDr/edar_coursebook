"0","A common error when writing `ggplot2` code is to put the `+` to add a geom or element at the beginning of a line rather than the end of a previous line-- in this case, R will try to execute the call too soon. If R gets to the end of a line and there is no indication to continue the call (e.g., `%>%` for piping or `+` for `ggplot2` plots), R interprets that as a message to run the call without reading in further code.  Thus, to avoid errors, be sure to end each line in `ggplot` calls with `+` (except for the final line when the call is actually over); don't start lines with `+`. "
"2","don't know how to handle 'block' engine output"
