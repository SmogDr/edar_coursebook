"0","**What is a blank?**  A *blank* is an attempt to challenge the instrument to measure nothing from something.  Let's say you had a scale to weigh the mass of cherries picked at an orchard. Each load of cherries is weighed in a small paper bag (so that they don't spill everywhere).  Then weighing the empty paper bag would be considered a ""blank"" for that instrument."
