"0","If you measure temperature with a k-type thermocouple and report a value of 93.28876 °C, you are admitting to the world your ignorance of precision (and the science of temperature measurement).  No thermocouple reading is repeatable to 5 decimal places in °C; the best thermocouples are accurate to one decimal degree. **Always make sure to align your measurement precision with the significant digits you report.** "
