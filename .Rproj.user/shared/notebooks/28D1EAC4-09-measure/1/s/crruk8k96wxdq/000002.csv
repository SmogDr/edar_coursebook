"0","**Hope** is a dangerous word in science because it can create *implicit bias*. The experimenter who *hopes* for a certain outcome might unknowingly influence their sampling and/or analysis strategy to promote that outcome.  The best experiments are designed as ""win/win"": they produce valuable information, regardless of the outcome (yes/no, null/alternative hypothesis, etc.). Such designs, though often difficult to conceive, remove the need for hope altogether. "
"2","don't know how to handle 'block' engine output"
